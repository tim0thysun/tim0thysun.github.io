            <p>4 White LEDs turn on one by one in sequence. Left to right, then right to left.</p>

            <figcaption>These white LEDs have a voltage drop of 3.3Vâ€”I calculated the resistance to be 285 Ohms. I used 4 1k Ohm resistors in my circuit but realized afterward that I also had 330 Ohm resistors as well, which would have been more appropriate.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>I used pins 13, 11, 10, and 9 from the Arduino as outputs. This is how I laid everything out on the breadboard.</figcaption>
